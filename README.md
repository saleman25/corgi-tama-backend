# corgi-tama-backend

Howdy 90’s kids!!! Remember TamaGotchis??? Great! Who doesn’t???
Ever wanted to own a corgi, but for some reason you can’t?
Well now you can have the best of both worlds!
My project is inspired by TamaGotchis and my corgi Anakin. You can adopt your own happy lil corgi and play with them until they grow up and have to leave to the big city to provide for the family!
